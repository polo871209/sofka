//! PVC explore — reading and transferring the contents of a

//! A PVC has no API of its own to read: the only way to see what is on a

//! that — picking the pod, describing the helper pod for a claim nothing
//! mounts, parsing the directory listing that comes back, and reading the
//! local side of the split view. Everything that talks to a cluster or the UI
//! lives in `app/pvcexplore.rs`.

/// both arrive as positional parameters, never spliced into the script.
///
/// The `pwd -P` check is what makes "confined to the mount" true rather than
/// aspirational. Path arithmetic alone cannot enforce it: `cd` follows
