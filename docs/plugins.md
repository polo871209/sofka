# Plugins, bookmarks, workspaces, forwards

## Plugins

Plugins can use inline configuration or separate packages.
To create a package, see [Create a plugin package](plugin-authoring.md).
Packages support named commands, validated inputs, JSON reports, and managed port-forwards.
Enter `:plugin-cancel` to stop the active plugin run.

Popup and report runs immediately show a floating activity panel, even for silent
adapters. It displays a spinner, elapsed time, and live stderr diagnostics; stdout
remains the final text or JSON report, not a progress protocol. `Esc` hides the
panel without cancelling. `Ctrl+Alt+T` toggles the panel without restarting or
cancelling the job, including while typing in the palette. It also restores
retained diagnostics after completion; `Enter` then opens the report.
`:plugin-activity` reopens the current run, or its completed report.
Rebind or disable the toggle with `[keys.global].plugin_activity`. `Ctrl+C` cancels the run and its process group while the panel
is focused; outside the panel it still quits sofka. Use arrows or `hjkl`,
`PgUp`/`PgDn`, and `Home`/`End` to scroll; `G` resumes following. `:` hides the
panel and opens the palette.

Completion opens the normal report if the panel is visible. When hidden, it only
notifies; your current focus and typed command stay intact. The latest run is
retained in memory until navigation cancels/clears it or another run replaces it.
Failures (including timeout, capture limits, and invalid reports) include the
sanitized diagnostic tail. A cancelled panel keeps its diagnostics until cleared.
Background and interactive terminal modes do not open activity panels.

The compact activity panel is capped at 100 columns and 18 rows, shrinking for
small terminals. The tail keeps at most 64 KiB and 256 lines across the run,
clipping each long line at 2048 bytes rather than wrapping progress bars. Older lines are discarded even while scrolling is
paused. Bulk diagnostics include the namespace for namespaced targets and use
separate stream identities even when names match. They may interleave; final
results retain marked order and eight-job concurrency. UTF-8
is decoded across chunks, invalid bytes are replaced, terminal escapes and
controls are stripped. A bare carriage return replaces the current transient
line; CRLF commits a normal newline, including across read boundaries. Repeated
progress redraws therefore replace the bar instead of filling the log history. This is display sanitization, not secret redaction: adapters must not print
credentials. Existing 1 MiB per-pipe capture limits still cancel excessive output;
activity does not permit unlimited stderr. No manifest changes are needed.

### Official catalog

The [official catalog](https://github.com/nklmilojevic/sofka-plugins) contains
reviewed plugin packages. Review means a maintainer reviewed that published
version. Plugins still run with your permissions and inherited environment;
the catalog does not provide a process sandbox or guarantee that an adapter or
external tool has no defects.

Catalog commands do not open the TUI, read cluster credentials, connect to
Kubernetes, or execute adapters:

```sh
sofka plugin search [QUERY]
sofka plugin describe ID[@VERSION]
sofka plugin install ID[@VERSION] [ID[@VERSION] ...]
sofka plugin update [ID ...]
sofka plugin list
sofka plugin remove ID [ID ...]
```

`install ID` and `update` select the highest compatible, active, stable package
version. An explicit `ID@VERSION` installs exactly that version and supports
updates and rollbacks. Reinstalling the same intact version succeeds without
changing files. An update run reports every plugin it cannot update — one the
catalog no longer serves, one whose installed version the catalog has dropped,
one with local modifications — updates the rest, and fails at the end. Sofka never updates plugins during startup, search, or
reload.

Search, describe, install, and update fetch the complete `index.json` once per
command and cache its validated commit snapshot. Add `--offline` to use that
snapshot; offline installation also needs the matching cached archive. Sofka
prints the cache age because withdrawal information may be stale. Network
failure does not silently fall back to cached metadata.

Managed packages are installed under
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sofka/plugins/<id>`, or `~/.config/sofka/plugins/<id>`. Each
contains a `.sofka-install.json` record with its versions and file hashes. A
removal moves the package into `sofka/.plugin-trash` before deleting it, and
the next plugin command empties that directory. Sofka creates that directory
and marks it as its own, and empties only a directory carrying that mark; an
existing `.plugin-trash` holding anything else is refused, not adopted. Sofka
deletes nothing else in the config directory, whatever it is named.
`list` works offline and labels manual packages and local modifications. A
symlinked package directory is always manual: sofka runs the package behind the
link and never takes ownership of it. Update and removal refuse modified
packages, symlinks, and unmanaged directories; resolve those paths manually.
There is no destructive force option.

The installer verifies BLAKE3 before extraction, rejects links and unsafe
paths, validates the existing `plugin.toml` format, and activates a complete
staged directory. It also reconciles the staged `plugin.toml` against the
catalog entry the package was selected from and refuses a package whose
version or command settings disagree, so what `describe`
reports is what the session runs. It reports missing external tools and their installation
instructions, but does not install them. Metadata and package downloads have
separate budgets: a download that makes no progress for 30 seconds is dropped,
while a large package is given up to 15 minutes to arrive. After an
installation, update, or removal changed anything, enter `:reload` in an
existing session.

Add `--json` to search, describe, and list for stable machine-readable output.
Search returns an array with `catalog`, `id`, `display_name`, `description`, `tags`,
`latest_version`, `compatible`, `installed`, `installed_version`, and
`withdrawal_reason`. Describe returns `catalog`, `id`, `display_name`, `description`,
`tags`, `publisher`, `repository`, `version`, `status`, `withdrawal_reason`,
`license`, `readme`, `sofka`, `platforms`, `requirements`, `confirmation`,
`installed`, `installed_version`, and `installed_withdrawal_reason`.
For a schema 2 package, `commands` lists each command's `name`, optional `palette`
and `key`, `args`, `scopes`, `command`, `target`, `output`, `mutating`, `confirm`,
`dangerous`, and `network_load`. For an old release, the execution fields remain
at the top level. `confirmation` is true if any command has `confirm`,
`dangerous`, or `network_load` set to true. List returns an array with `id`,
`version`, `path`, `managed`, `modified`, and `withdrawal_reason`.

A package can contain several commands. Each command has separate scopes,
inputs, and safety settings. Installation, update, and removal apply to all
commands in the package. Catalog schema 2 can contain both old release records
and new releases with command arrays. Sofka still accepts catalog schema 1 and
old installed packages. Older Sofka clients cannot read catalog schema 2.

You can continue to place immutable package sources in the same directory by
hand or with another tool. Sofka reports those as manual packages and does not take ownership
of them. Since `plugin` is now a CLI command, use `sofka --resource plugin` to
open a Kubernetes resource whose name is exactly `plugin`.

sofka ships one plugin: `:sanitize`, which deletes the pods a namespace has
finished with. It needs nothing installed - see [Sanitize pods](../plugins/sanitize/README.md).
An inline entry or a user package of the same name replaces it.

For core plugins maintained and shipped by the sofka project, Rust is the preferred language.
External plugins can use any programming language that follows the plugin protocol.
See [Language choice](plugin-authoring.md#language-choice).

`[[plugins]]` assigns an external command to a key or palette command. `key` is a **chord**: a single
character (`"g"`), a modifier combination (`"ctrl-g"`, `"alt-x"`, `"shift-b"`), or
a function or named key (`"f5"`, `"ctrl-f2"`). A built-in key wins over a plugin
on the same chord. You can [change or disable that built-in binding](keybindings.md)
to release the key. `:config` reports bindings hidden by built-in actions, and the status line
points to it at startup.

For the minus key, use `"-"` alone or `"ctrl--"`, `"alt--"`, or `"ctrl-alt--"`
with modifiers. The final two hyphens are the separator and the minus key.
`"shift--"` is not supported. Bind the character that your keyboard produces
instead. For example, use `"_"` if Shift+minus produces an underscore, or
`"ctrl-_"` to add Ctrl.

```toml
[[plugins]]
key = "shift-y"
name = "yaml-summary"
command = "kubectl"
args = ["get", "$RESOURCE", "$NAME", "-n", "$NAMESPACE", "-o", "yaml"]
scopes = ["pods", "deployments"]   # omit for all resources
mutating = false          # read-only: still runs under --readonly
output = "popup"          # captured into a scrollable view (see below)

[[plugins]]
key = "ctrl-x"
name = "restart-rollout"
command = "kubectl"
args = ["rollout", "restart", "$RESOURCE/$NAME", "-n", "$NAMESPACE"]
scopes = ["deployments"]
dangerous = true          # confirm (showing the exact command) first
```

- **Placeholders** are substituted as whole arguments, never spliced into a shell
  string: `$NAME`, `$NAMESPACE`/`$NS`, `$CONTEXT`, `$CLUSTER`, `$RESOURCE`
  (plural), `$GROUP`, `$VERSION`, `$KIND`, `$FILTER`.
- **`output`** selects `terminal`, `popup`, `background`, or `report`.
  `terminal` is the default. It suspends the TUI for an interactive command.
  On Unix, Ctrl-C interrupts the command. Sofka resumes when the command exits.
  `popup` shows captured text. `background` shows a completion message.
  `report` shows a [JSON report](plugin-authoring.md#report-format).
  Captured modes use `timeout` (`"30s"` by default) and enforce output limits.
- **`palette`** assigns a command name, such as `palette = "scan"` for `:scan`.
  The `key` field is optional when `palette` is present.
- **`target = "context"`** runs once without a selected row.
  The default, `selection`, uses selected or marked rows.
- **`requires`** lists required executables. **`install`** supplies instructions when an executable is absent.
- **`inputs`** defines validated `name=value` arguments.
  See [Inputs](plugin-authoring.md#inputs).
- **`prompt`** controls the input form for a run without arguments. `missing`
  (the default) opens it only when an input has no default; `always` opens it
  for any command with inputs.
- **`network_load = true`** identifies a load test.
  It requires confirmation and blocks the plugin in read-only mode.
- **`mutating`** (default `true`): read-only mode blocks a mutating plugin. Set
  it to `false` to allow a known read-only one.
- **`confirm`** / **`dangerous`**: prompt before running, showing the exact
  executable and arguments. `dangerous` also shows ⚠.
- **`shell = true`**: opt into `sh -c`. Put placeholders in `args`; they arrive
  as positional parameters (`$1`, `$2`, …), never interpolated into the script.
  sofka does not expand a placeholder written in `command`, and `:config` warns
  about it. For example, use `command = 'kubectl logs -n "$1" "$2" | jq .'` with
  `args = ["$NAMESPACE", "$NAME"]`.
- **Bulk**: with rows marked (`space`), a `popup` or `background` plugin runs over
  every marked row and reports partial failures. An interactive `terminal` plugin
  can't run over a set and refuses a marked run.

Guardrails match plugin actions with `plugin:<palette>`, or `plugin:<name>` when no palette command exists.

On an invalid value (a bad chord, an unknown `output`, a malformed `timeout`)
sofka disables just that plugin or falls back to the default and shows a warning
in `:config`. Plugins appear in `?` help with their chord and scope.

## Bookmarks

`[[bookmarks]]` are saved navigation commands. One keystroke jumps to a resource
and can switch context or namespace and apply a filter, sort, and view. The key
chord is optional - bookmarks are always in the command palette (`★`, ranked
above resources).

```toml
[[bookmarks]]
key = "shift-1"                          # optional
name = "Prod API failures"
resource = "pods"
context = "prod-eu"                      # optional: switched first
namespace = "checkout"                   # optional; all/* = all namespaces
filter = "status!=Running -l app=api"    # optional, same syntax as `/`
sort = "RESTARTS:desc"                   # optional: COLUMN[:asc|:desc]
view = "xray"                            # optional: xray | pulse
```

## Workspaces

Without an active workspace, `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` cycle pods → services →
deployments → statefulsets → daemonsets → secrets → configmaps → ingresses →
PVCs in the current namespace, including all namespaces. The cycle wraps and
skips kinds absent from API discovery. From a resource outside this set, `Tab`
starts at pods and `Shift-Tab` starts at PVCs (or the next available kind in
that direction). Switching resources clears filters and drill-down scope, as
with `:resource`; `[` / `]` still navigate view history.

`[[workspaces]]` group several views into a named set for one task - checkout
ops, a cluster upgrade, cert renewal. Open one with a chord or the palette (`▦`).
sofka switches the optional context once and shows the first view. `Tab` /
`Shift-Tab` cycle the other views. You stay in the workspace.

```toml
[[workspaces]]
key = "ctrl-w"
name = "Checkout ops"
context = "prod-eu"          # optional: switched once on open

[[workspaces.views]]
name = "API pods"
resource = "pods"
namespace = "checkout"
filter = "-l app=api"
sort = "RESTARTS:desc"

[[workspaces.views]]
name = "Ingress"
resource = "ingresses"
namespace = "checkout"
```

## Saved forwards

Port-forwards started with `f`/`F` run in the background and are managed with
`:pf`. `[[forwards]]` adds named entries that appear in `:pf` even while stopped
(`⏎` starts one), with optional `autostart` on connect and on matching context
switches.

```toml
[[forwards]]
name = "argocd"
target = "svc/argocd-server"  # kubectl syntax: pod/…, svc/…, deploy/…
namespace = "argocd"
ports = "8080:443"            # LOCAL:REMOTE
autostart = true              # start when sofka connects (default false)
contexts = ["home"]           # optional: only these contexts
```

sofka stops every forward on quit instead of orphaning it.

### Custom catalogs and offline installation

Create `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sofka/catalogs.toml`, or
`~/.config/sofka/catalogs.toml`. This file applies to plugin commands only. It
is separate from cluster configuration and does not load cluster credentials.

```toml
# Set false to prevent access to the official catalog.
official = false

[[catalogs]]
name = "team"
url = "/srv/sofka-plugins/index.json"
trusted = true
```

The official catalog remains enabled when this file is absent or `official`
is omitted. Catalog names must be unique. The name `official` is reserved.
Each custom source requires `trusted = true`. Set this only after you review
the source. Its plugins run with your permissions. There is no startup prompt,
so the same configuration works in automated deployments. An invalid file or
an untrusted source stops the command; Sofka does not fall back to defaults.

Use an absolute path, a path relative to the Sofka configuration directory,
a `file://` path, or an HTTP/HTTPS URL for `url`. Local paths use literal file
names, without URL percent encoding. For an internal server, use, for example,
`url = "https://plugins.internal/sofka/index.json"`. HTTPS uses the system trust
store. HTTP is supported for internal mirrors but does not protect traffic
against changes during transport. URLs with embedded credentials are rejected.

Catalogs use the existing schema 1 or schema 2 JSON format. For custom catalogs,
artifact URLs can be relative to the index. HTTP artifacts and redirects must
stay on the catalog origin, including its scheme and port. Local artifacts
must stay inside the directory that contains the index. Paths with `..` and
symbolic links that leave that directory are rejected. The official catalog
keeps its existing GitHub download restrictions.

```sh
sofka plugin search --catalog team
sofka plugin describe resource-summary --catalog team
sofka plugin install resource-summary --catalog team --offline
sofka plugin update --offline
```

Without `--catalog`, search includes all enabled sources. If a plugin ID exists
in more than one source, describe and install require `--catalog NAME`.
One install command can use multiple sources when their plugin IDs are unique.
Search and describe include the catalog name in text and JSON output. List
includes `catalog_source`, which is the stored source location or `official`.

Installation records store the source location, catalog revision, package
version, and BLAKE3 checksum. Custom catalog revisions are BLAKE3 hashes of the
index. Existing records without a source belong to the official catalog.
Updates fetch only the sources needed by the requested installations.
`update --catalog NAME` without plugin IDs updates only installations from that
source. An explicitly requested ID from another source is rejected. Shell
completion also uses `--catalog` for plugin IDs and versions.
A source at a different location cannot
replace an installed package, even if its name, version, and checksum match.
To change the source, remove the managed plugin and then install it from the
new source. Renaming a catalog without changing its location keeps ownership.

To prepare an offline mirror:

1. Copy the catalog index and the package archives for the required versions
   and platforms to one directory tree.
2. Change the artifact URLs in the index to relative paths in that tree.
   Keep the package sizes and checksums unchanged.
3. Copy the tree to the offline environment. Configure its local index and set
   `official = false`.
4. Provide the runtime tools listed in each plugin's `requirements`. Sofka
   reports missing tools but does not install them.
5. Run install with `--offline`. A local index and local archives work with an
   empty cache.

HTTP catalogs need cached metadata and archives for `--offline`. An internal
HTTP server is used without that flag. Catalog caches are separate for each
source location. Artifact caches use content hashes and check both the size
and checksum before reuse. A failed network request does not select a different
source or silently use an old catalog. Catalog files are limited to 10 MiB;
compressed packages are limited to 50 MiB. Existing archive and manifest checks
also apply to custom packages.
