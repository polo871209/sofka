# Providers and fleet

The metrics provider autodiscovers in-cluster by default. Configure it only to
point at an external endpoint or to change the defaults.

## Right-sizing (metrics provider)

`:rightsize` on a workload (or pod) estimates right-sized requests from past
usage in a **Prometheus-compatible** backend - Prometheus or VictoriaMetrics,
which share the query API. Per container it shows the current requests, P50/P95/P99
CPU and memory over the window, a suggested request (P95 plus headroom), OOM and
throttle evidence, and a **strategic-merge patch preview** (`c` copies it). It
**never mutates** - apply the patch with `kubectl patch` yourself if you agree.

Pod queries match the exact name. Workload queries match the standard pod-name
format for the selected controller: a template hash and random suffix for
Deployments, an ordinal for StatefulSets, and a random suffix for ReplicaSets
and DaemonSets. This excludes pods from workloads with longer name prefixes,
such as `api-worker` when `api` is selected, while retaining past rollout data.
Names are matched literally, including dots. Matching uses names, not verified
owner references; adopted pods with other names are not included, and a name
that follows the same format can still match. The backend must contain data
for the selected cluster and namespace.

The patch uses `spec.containers` for a Pod and `spec.template.spec.containers`
for a workload. Kubernetes can still reject a resource change that the cluster
does not support.

With no `[providers.metrics]` section, sofka finds a Prometheus or
VictoriaMetrics query `Service` in the cluster by well-known labels and reaches
it through the API-server proxy.

```toml
[providers.metrics]
type = "prometheus"        # or "victoriametrics" (same query API)
url = "https://prom.example.com"   # omit to autodiscover in-cluster
window = "7d"              # lookback for the P50/P95/P99 quantiles
step = "5m"                # subquery resolution for the CPU rate()
headroom = 15              # percent added over P95 for the suggestion

[providers.metrics.headers]        # optional
Authorization = "Bearer <token>"
```

It uses the standard cAdvisor metric names
(`container_cpu_usage_seconds_total`, `container_memory_working_set_bytes`,
`container_oom_events_total`, `container_cpu_cfs_throttled_periods_total`).
VictoriaMetrics **cluster** mode (vmselect) needs a tenant path in the `url`.
Single-node VM and Prometheus serve the API at the root and autodiscover fine.

## Cloud logs (GKE)

`L` (or `:cloudlogs`) opens the GKE Logs Explorer in the browser, with a query for the selection over the last hour. It works on pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, ReplicaSets, Jobs, CronJobs, Services, namespaces, and nodes. In the container picker, `L` adds the container to the pod query.

sofka reads the project, location, and cluster from the kubeconfig cluster name, which GKE writes as `gke_<project>_<location>_<cluster>`. On any other cluster, `L` shows a warning and opens nothing. Cloud logs need no configuration.

Workloads and Services match their pods by the pod selector (`matchLabels` and `matchExpressions`), so the query also finds restarted and deleted pods, and never pods of another workload. GKE writes the pod label `app.kubernetes.io/name` as the log label `k8s-pod/app_kubernetes_io/name`. A CronJob has no selector, so its query uses the `logging.gke.io/top_level_controller_name` label that GKE adds to the CronJob's pods.

sofka opens the URL with `open` on macOS and `xdg-open` on Linux, and sends no credentials. The browser must be logged in to the Google Cloud console.

## Fleet dashboard

`:fleet` summarizes several clusters side by side so you don't have to switch
through them. It's **opt-in** - sofka queries only the contexts you list.

```toml
[fleet]
contexts = ["prod-eu", "prod-us", "staging"]
```

You can also build or edit the fleet from inside the TUI: in the `:ctx`
switcher, `space` toggles the highlighted context in or out of the fleet
(members show a `✓`). These marks are saved to `<state-dir>/fleet.toml`
(`~/.local/state/sofka/fleet.toml` by default; see `sofka info`) and overlay
the `[fleet] contexts` list on every start - sofka never rewrites your config
file, so the config stays the hand-edited base list and marks can both add to
it and mask entries out.

Contexts are gathered concurrently with a per-context timeout, so an unreachable
or slow cluster shows an error on its own row instead of blocking the others.
Each row shows connectivity, Kubernetes version, node readiness, the unhealthy
pod count, Flux `Ready=False` failures, the count of Argo CD Applications that
are `OutOfSync` or whose health is `Degraded`, `Missing` or `Unknown`, and the
resolved read-only policy. A cluster without the Flux or Argo CD CRDs shows `—`
for that column rather than a zero. `Progressing` Applications are not counted,
a rollout in flight is not a fault. `⏎`
switches to the highlighted context (through the normal context-switch path), `r`
gathers again. Only these non-sensitive summaries are kept, in memory.
